# baseline

baseline is a minimalist framework to share domain-specific logic between the client and the server in full stack JavaScript applications.

Use baseline in the browser to enable client-side applications to execute domain-specific logic at blazing speeds, and in the backend as the domain layer of an [onion style architecture](https://www.codeguru.com/csharp/understanding-onion-architecture/).

Interested in pushing boundaries with isomorphic JavaScript? At Rotunda Software, baseline [is a centerpiece](https://www.rotundasoftware.com/blog/rotunda/baseline?r=1) of applications that support over a million users, and we're actively looking to join forces with like-minded adventurers.
