# baseline

baseline is a minimalist framework for organizing and executing domain-specific logic in memory, completely free of external dependencies.

A baseline instance may be used in the browser to give applications an unprecedented ability to execute domain-specific logic in real time, and may also be used in the backend as the domain layer of a [onion style architecture](https://www.codeguru.com/csharp/understanding-onion-architecture/). The result is a simple, completely isomorphic JavaScript execution environment.

Interested in learning more? At [Rotunda Software](https://www.rotundasoftware.com/), baseline is a centerpiece of applications that support over a million users. We're actively looking for somebody to explore this frontier and document our work to share it with others. If that kind of adventure sounds appealing to you, please put your name in the hat by applying for an [open position](https://www.rotundasoftware.com/careers).
