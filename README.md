# baseline

baseline is a minimalist framework for organizing and executing domain-specific logic in memory, completely free of external dependencies.

A baseline instance may be used in the browser to give applications an unprecedented ability to execute domain-specific logic in real time, and may also be used in the backend as the domain layer of a [onion style architecture](https://www.codeguru.com/csharp/understanding-onion-architecture/). The result is a simple but completely isomorphic javascript execution environment for domain-specific logic.

At [Rotunda Software](https://www.rotundasoftware.com/), baseline is a centerpiece of applications that support over a million users.
